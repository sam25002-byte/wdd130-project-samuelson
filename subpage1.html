            <p class="row1">A rake pick has a jagged or wavy hape that allows it to move across multiple pins inside a lock at once. Locksmiths often use rakes during quick evaluations or when testing how smoothly a lock’s pins move. While less precise than a hook pick, it provides helpful information about the general feel and responsiveness of a lock’s internal mechanism.</p>

            <p class="row1">Lockpicks are small, specialized tools designed to manipulate the internal pins or mechanisms inside a lock so it can be opened without the original key. They are most commonly used by locksmiths, maintenance workers, and security professionals for legitimate purposes—such as helping people who are locked out, repairing locks, or testing a lock’s vulnerability during security assessments. When used responsibly and legally, lockpicks play an important role in understanding and improving security systems.</p>

            <p class="row1">A tension wrench is a small, L-shaped piece of metal used to apply slight rotational pressure to a lock’s core. This pressure simulates the turning motion of a key, allowing the internal components to bind in a way that a locksmith or security professional can study and manipulate. It’s one of the most essential tools in legal lock-related work because it lets professionals feel feedback from the lock and understand how its mechanism behaves.</p>

            <p class="row2">A hook pick is a thin tool with a small curved tip designed to gently lift the internal pins of a lock one at a time. Security professionals use hook picks to examine how each pin responds inside the lock, helping them diagnose mechanical issues or test lock quality. Its precise shape makes it useful for gaining insight into the condition of individual components during repairs or assessments.</p>

            <p class="row2">Pinning tweezers are fine, narrow tweezers used to handle tiny lock components during maintenance or reassembly. Professionals use them when re-pinning or repairing locks to ensure that the small pieces are placed securely and accurately. Their design offers enough precision to work with delicate internal parts without damaging them.</p>

        <div class="bodyitem6">
            <p class="row2">A practice lock is a specially designed training tool built so that the internal pins or wafers can be seen or studied. These locks are used by students, locksmith trainees, and security specialists to understand how mechanical locks operate. Because the inner components are visible, practice locks offer a safe, legal way to learn about lock mechanisms without interacting with real property.</p>
